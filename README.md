# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

| 1  | Beautiful is better than ugly.                                                           |
| 2  | Explicit is better than implicit.                                                        |
| 3  | Simple is better than complex.                                                           |
| 4  | Complex is better than complicated.                                                      |
| 5  | Flat is better than nested.                                                              |
| 6  | Sparse is better than dense.                                                             |
| 7  | Readability counts.                                                                      |
| 8  | Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.                                  |
| 9  | Although practicality beats purity.                                                      |
| 10 | Errors should never pass silently.                                                       |
| 11 | Unless explicitly silenced.                                                              |
| 12 | In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.                                |
| 13 | There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.                    |
| 14 | Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.                       |
| 15 | Now is better than never.                                                                |
| 16 | Although never is often better than *right* now.                                         |
| 17 | If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.                               |
| 18 | If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.                         |
| 19 | Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!                         |
